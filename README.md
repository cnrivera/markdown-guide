# A Simple Markdown Style Guide (Written in Basic Markdown)

This guide was created for those new to markdown or who want an easy reference covering the basics. It was intended to be an example of the topic it explains, and is ideally viewed with the markdown file next to a preview of the rendered text.

You will need:

* The simple-markdown-style-guide.md file.
* A text editor of your choice, such as Atom or Visual Studio Code.
    * If using the Chrome browser, you can install the Markdown Viewer Chrome extension to view the rendered text in your browser while viewing the markdown file in any basic text editor.
* Time to review and practice.

This guide is based on the **CommonMark** style.
